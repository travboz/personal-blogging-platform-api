## Description

This is a RESTful API designed to power a personal blog. It provides endpoints to manage blog articles, allowing for full CRUD functionality â€” Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Articles can be listed, filtered by tags or publish date, retrieved individually by ID, and managed through standard HTTP methods.
